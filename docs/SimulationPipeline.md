# Simulation Pipeline
Mainly the goal of this project was to calculate average blood velocity based on CT-MPI dataset using the Advection-Diffusion equation. Below is the one dimentional advection diffusion equation along the z-axis where $w$ is the velocity component of the fluid along the z-axis:

$\nabla C$

$dC/dt = w.dC/dz + D*d^2C/dz^2$
