# to do list of this project
The goal of this repository is to contain all of the scripts and their test uses in contrast dispersion.
to dos:
 - modify the scripts to a not case specific class
 - add test folder to test the process further
 - Laminar flow study
 - turbulant flow study + develope scripts
 - patients data study
 - develop back calculation models:
    - Parastou's
    - higher-order
    - fft
 - update readme with proper abstract information
 - add proper docs:
    - Background
    - Our Avection Diffusion pipeline validation against the theoretical solution
    - method (Latex?)
    - results (either md or excel)
    - discussion

Friday Sept 29 TODOs:
   - Straight Pipe Segmentation and Meshing: **Done**
   - Generate Oasis Mesh **Done**
   - Submit CFD for a Re of 500 (Check Re of Parastou's) **Submitted**
   - Advection Diffusion for the laminar flow 
   - fft func

Sat Sep 30 TODOs:
   - Advection Diffusion for the laminar flow
   - fft func
   - Parastou's method results for data, Results excel sheet
